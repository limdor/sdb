# About this repository

Everything started when I read this [series of blog posts](https://tartanllama.xyz/tags/writing-a-linux-debugger/) from Sy Brand about writting a debugger. The series was amazing, and I wanted more. And then something great happened, in 2025 [a book came out](https://nostarch.com/building-a-debugger).

After talking to Sy in NDC TechTown 2025, I realized how much I wanted it. And here I am, this is the repository that contains the code written while reading the book. In the end, it will most probably be very similar to [the original source code](https://github.com/TartanLlama/sdb).
